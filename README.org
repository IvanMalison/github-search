* Status
github-search depends on code that has not yet made it into gh.el
https://github.com/sigma/gh.el/pull/70
You'll need to use the version of gh.el from that pull request to get things to work for now.
* Installation

Install from MELPA with ~M-x package-install org-projectile~. See the [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][melpa repository]] for details about how to set up MELPA if you have not already done so.
* Usage
Run the command ~github-search-clone-repo~ and select a repository and a location to which to clone said repository.
